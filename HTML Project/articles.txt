Cheetah project: Lessons from the trout era

The cheetah population in Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park has increased marginally again. The arrival of 12 more cheetahs from South Africa demonstrates the government’s determination to reintroduce and establish cheetahs to India, once again.

The euphoria around this cheetah project is reminiscent of the British government’s drive to introduce trout fish into Indian rivers a century and a half ago. Interestingly, the first shipment of trout eggs to India was made 157 years ago in the month of February aboard a vessel called the SS Mongolia. With this, the endeavour to introduce trout in Indian streams began, which lasted several decades. The trout efforts are crucial to mention because, while the cases of cheetahs and trout are very different, there are many parallels between these two projects.

A species was granted a privilege pass into India’s ecosystem in both cases. In both occasions, the government’s resources, a whole lot of staff and a number of experts were thrown into the initiative to ensure its success. Furthermore, like the cheetah, the introduction of trout was not a one-time occurrence; extensive stocking had been designed to ensure a positive result.

Six months ago, it was reported that to ensure no shortage of food for the cheetahs coming to Kuno, the Forest Department has made arrangements for 250 cheetals, the little spotted dear. It is a separate matter that later on it was officially denied. But, it reminded of another occurrence when rainbow trout were introduced to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where it was introduced alongside India.

The trout’s journey
When rainbow trout became established in Ceylon’s hilly rivers, some anglers grumbled that Ceylon trout rarely rose to native flies. George Fowler, a top British civil servant and colonel secretory at the time, proposed importing English mayflies to tempt them. While the popularity of trout fishing was growing by the day, a massive supply of mayflies was sent from England, but it was in vain. Eventually, extensive research was conducted to identify several indigenous flies that were more acceptable to Ceylon trout.

The similarity between the cheetah and the trout ends here. Trout is a fish that Mother Nature did not create for the Indian ecosystem. The British rulers of the time wanted to see their favourite fish in India, therefore it was transported with a lot of effort. They longed to hunt it and could not forget the taste, which had travelled with them across the seven seas to India. The recreational opportunities for British colonialists were a key driver for the transplantation of trout in India.

It was not easy to transport trout to India at the time. Air transport over such distances had not yet begun, and preserving trout eggs on the long journey across the ocean was nearly impossible. The introduction of trout in India is a one-of-a-kind and remarkable story of magnificent passion, numerous failures, and final triumph. At the same time, no consideration was given to native species that were forced to share natural resources with this invasive invader.

Native cheetah
The cheetah, on the other hand, is native to India. This is a species that has only been originated in this area. Nature designed it for the same climate found in India’s plains. We lost it more than 70 years ago as a result of deforestation and widespread hunting. The initiative undertaken in Kuno represents the cheetah’s return home. Though instead of the traditional Asiatic cheetah of India, the African cheetah is now being introduced.

At the moment, it is not possible to import Asiatic Cheetahs into India. These cheetahs can currently only be found in Iran. There too their number is only a little more than a dozen. When a species entirely disappears from a location, there is no other way to re-establish its nearest sub-species in that area.

It will not be easy either. Cheetahs are being reintroduced to an area where there hasn’t been this feline in more than 70 years. Throughout this time, the local ecosystem has evolved to live without cheetahs. It remains to be seen what type of stress the introduction of cheetahs and unique food arrangements would put on this environment.

Worryingly, the cheetah project is being portrayed as a political achievement. This is where we should recall the trout transplantation in India. After India become independent trout started to disappear from Indian streams, along with their erstwhile promoters. Political public relations has its own set of issues.

South African cheetahs in India eating and healthy
Twelve South African cheetahs flown to India last Friday are healthy and eating well in their new home in Kuno National Park, manager of the Cheetah Metapopulation Project in Southern Africa Vincent van der Merwe said on Friday morning. 

“They took well to their first meal, a spotted deer fed to each cheetah on Sunday afternoon,” said Van der Merwe, who accompanied the cheetahs from the South African bushveld across the ocean to India.

This transnational relocation is risky for the cats, and controversial, but the 12 scientists supporting it hope the project will boost the cheetah population worldwide and in India, where the Asiatic cheetahs went extinct.  

The South African cheetahs’ arrival follows that of eight Namibian cheetahs, which came to Kuno National Park last September. On Tuesday the newcomers had a surprising encounter when “things hotted up a little”, said Van der Merwe.  

“One of the Namibian cheetahs chased a Nilgai (buck) through the boma fencing and made his way towards the newly-arrived South African cheetahs, threatening their quarantine status. The Indian veterinary teams responded swiftly, and the animal was moved back into his five-hectare hunting enclosure. 

“These cheetahs are going to have to be vigilant when the quarantine gates are opened and they are released into the wilds of India!” said Van der Merwe, who explained they selected “predator savvy” animals for this mission. 

“Five days after the arrival of the cheetahs, South African and Indian conservation teams enjoyed a walk through the Kuno forests where we spotted plentiful tiger, hyena, and leopard spoor. Sloth bears scratch marks were evident on the forest trees.  

“A large Mugger crocodile was spotted devouring a smaller Gharial crocodilian on the banks of the Kuno River, providing a reminder of the hard nature of the release environment,” he said. 

Kuno National Park, in the central Indian province of Madhya Pradesh, has no fences unlike South African parks but the environment has been assessed as suitable for the cheetahs’ survival. 

Helicopters flew the cheetahs to Kuno, allowing their relocation to be wrapped up in under 24 hours from the time they were darted, driven in their crates to OR Tambo International Airport and picked up by the Indian Air Force. 

Four of the cheetahs came from Limpopo, three from the Northern Cape, three from KwaZulu-Natal and two from the Eastern Cape, and they have been quarantined in their original groups.  

If two of the females reproduce, the project will be considered a success said Van der Merwe.

India’s Project Cheetah: A Step Towards Conserving Endangered Species

Project Cheetah is an ambitious initiative taken by the Indian government to reintroduce cheetahs, an endangered species, back into the wild. The project aims to revive the population of cheetahs in India after they were declared extinct in the country in 1952 due to hunting and habitat loss.

The Indian government has identified three potential sites for the reintroduction of cheetahs – Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, and Shahgarh Landscape in Rajasthan. These sites have been chosen based on their suitability for the species and the availability of prey species.

The project is a collaboration between the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Wildlife Trust of India, and other conservation organizations. The project team will work closely with local communities, forest officials, and experts to ensure the success of the project.

The reintroduction of cheetahs in India is a significant step towards conserving endangered species and protecting biodiversity. The project will also provide economic benefits to local communities through eco-tourism and create employment opportunities.

The cheetah is an iconic and charismatic species, known for its incredible speed and agility. However, the cheetah is also one of the most endangered big cats in the world, with only an estimated 7,000 individuals remaining in the wild. Habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict have led to a significant decline in the population of cheetahs worldwide.

The reintroduction of cheetahs in India will not only help to conserve the species but also promote the restoration of grassland ecosystems. The cheetah is a keystone species that plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of grassland ecosystems by controlling the population of herbivores and preventing overgrazing.

The project team will use a scientific approach to ensure the successful reintroduction of cheetahs in India. The first phase of the project will involve creating a suitable habitat for the species and reintroducing a small population of cheetahs from Africa. The project team will closely monitor the population and work towards establishing a self-sustaining population of cheetahs in the wild.

The project has received support from conservation organizations and the public, and it is hoped that the project will be a model for other countries looking to reintroduce endangered species into the wild.

In conclusion, India’s Project Cheetah is a critical step towards conserving endangered species and promoting the restoration of grassland ecosystems. The project has the potential to create a self-sustaining population of cheetahs in the wild and provide economic benefits to local communities. The success of the project will depend on the collaboration of various stakeholders, including local communities, conservation organizations, and government agencies. With the right approach and support, India’s Project Cheetah can pave the way for the conservation of endangered species worldwide.
